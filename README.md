## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text-Emotion-Classification.git
cd Text-Emotion-Classification
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

import interact
model, tokenizer = interact.get_main_outcome()
emotion = interact.predict_emotion(model, tokenizer, "I love this project!")
print(emotion)  # Output: 'love'
```

## üß† Model Architecture

The model combines the power of BERT tokenization with a custom CNN architecture:

- **BERT Tokenization**: For advanced text understanding
- **Word Embeddings**: 128-dimensional embeddings
- **1D Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction
- **Global Average Pooling**: For dimensionality reduction
- **Fully Connected Layer**: For final classification

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Customize your model through `config.py`:

```python
{
    "NUM_EPOCHS": 7,           # Number of training epochs
    "BATCH_SIZE": 32,          # Batch size for training
    "LEARNING_RATE": 0.001,    # Learning rate
    "EMBEDDING_DIM": 128,      # Embedding dimension
    "NUM_CLASSES": 6,          # Number of emotion classes
    "DEVICE": "cuda",          # Training device (cuda/cpu)
    "DATASET_NAME": "emotion", # Dataset name
    "EMOTION_LABELS": [        # Emotion labels
        "sadness",
        "joy",
        "love",
        "anger",
        "fear",
        "surprise"
    ]
}
```

## üìä Performance

The model achieves the following performance metrics:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Test Accuracy |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1     | 1.4731        | 57.85%        |
